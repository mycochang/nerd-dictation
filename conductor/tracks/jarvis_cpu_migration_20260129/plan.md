# Implementation Plan: Jarvis CPU Migration

## Phase 1: Migration & Tuning
- [ ] Task: Update `scripts/jarvis_daemon.py` to force CPU inference
- [ ] Task: Create `tests/test_latency.py` to benchmark CPU performance
- [ ] Task: Tune model size (tiny vs base) for speed/accuracy balance
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Migration & Tuning' (Protocol in workflow.md)
