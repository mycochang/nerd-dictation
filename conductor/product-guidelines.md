# Product Guidelines

## Interaction Design
- **Tone:** Technical and Minimal. Feedback should be concise and purely functional, focusing on the status of commands and the result of dictations. This is designed to reduce cognitive load and keep the user in the "flow."
- **Visual Feedback:** Stealth Mode. The system should maintain a minimal visual footprint. Feedback should prioritize audio cues or subtle notifications over large popups or windows to avoid distracting from the coding task at hand.

## Behavioral Principles
- **Speed First:** Every part of the pipeline—from trigger to typing—must be optimized for the lowest possible latency.
- **Accuracy over Fluff:** Prioritize high-fidelity transcription and command mapping over conversational filler.
- **Fail Silently/Cleanly:** If a transcription fails or a command is unrecognized, the system should reset without interrupting the user's primary workflow.
